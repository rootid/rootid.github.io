      <li>What is Shlemiel the Painter‚Äôs Algorithm? How and why is it inefficient?</li>
      <li>Fixed allocation v/s Malloc
        <ul>
          <li>Why Malloc is slow? and how it allocates the memory? (allocating blocks of memory that are powers of 2 in size. It never wastes more than 50 percent of the space)</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>How to use realloc? - double the size of memory that was previously allocated. That means that you never have to call realloc more than lg(n). times,</li>
      <li>
        <p>XML v/s RDBMS - Why choose RDBMS over XML for large data? Hint- Lexing and Parsing are the slowest operations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>How to structure the application from code to testing.
        <ul>
          <li>Usual problems are
            <ol>
              <li>Most of the time specs are missing.</li>
              <li>Build takes more than one step.</li>
              <li>Scope creeps add additional features.</li>

          <li>What is encoding? eg. UTF-8</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Why specs are needed?
        <ul>

              <li>Functional - How product will work from user‚Äôs perspective.</li>
              <li>Techincal - It talks about data structures, relational database models, choice of programming languages and tools, algorithm, etc.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>

      <li>Don‚Äôt be scare by Architecture Astronauts
        <ul>
          <li>When you go too far up, abstraction-wise, you run out of oxygen. Sometimes, smart thinkers just don‚Äôt know when to stop, and they create these absurd, all-encompassing, high-level pictures of the universe that are all good and fine, but don‚Äôt actually mean anything at all.</li>

      <li>How to look for passionate candidates?</li>
      <li>The law of leaky abstraction
        <ul>
          <li>All nontrivial abstractions, to some degree, are leaky. eg. TCP, SQL, NFS, C++ strings</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Measurement - how to measure the performance of the employee?</p>
      </li>
      <li>How to showcase project?
        <ul>
          <li>If you show a nonprogrammer a screen that has a user interface that is 90 percent worse, they will think that the program is 90 percent worse.</li>
          <li>If you show a nonprogrammer a screen with a user interface that is 100 percent beautiful, they will think that the program is almost done.
When politics demands that various nontechnical managers or customers ‚Äúsign off‚Äù on a project, give them several versions of the graphic design to choose from.</li>
          <li>When you‚Äôre showing off, the only thing that matters is the screen shot. Make it 100 percent beautiful.</li>

    <p>NIH syndrome/Reinventing wheel is bad. Always think to built a layer on top of existing one.</p>

  <li>80/20 rule -
    <ul>
      <li>80 percent of the people use 20 percent of the features. So you convince yourself that you only need to implement 20 percent of the features, and you can still sell 80 percent as many copies. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs never the same 20 percent. Everybody uses a different set of features</li>
