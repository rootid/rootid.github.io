* Part one: Managing People

  * Interaction with Bill gates, first impression - He read all 500 pages and added his notes.

  * Places to look for the great developers
    - Never on the market,
    - Attend great conferences like Apple's WWDC, Microsoft's PDC or any other open source conferences
    - Build the community - It is hard.

  * Field guide to developers
    - Care about environment, problems but not money.
    - Focus on their environment and toys(Chair- Aerons, Monitor- LCD screen 30")

  * 3 Management techniques
     1. Command and control mangement - Works well in millitary
     2. Econ 101
          - Extrinsic motivation
          - Increases the scope for manipulation.
     3. The Identity Management -
          - Creates single family,cohesive culture
          - Increases loyalty and commitment to their coworkers.

  * Hit and run management v/s Silicon valley management
      - Managers exist to get furniture out of the way so the real talent can do brilliant work.

* Part two: Advice to Potential Programmers
    - Learn how to write before graduating.
      - Start a journal or weblog. The more you write, the easier it will be,
    - Learn C before graduating.
      - C is important than JAVA
    - Learn microeconomics before graduating.
      - Understand NPVs and discounting and marginal utility
    - Take programming-intensive courses.
      - eg. Yale courses
        - 201, 223, 240
        - 323, 368
        - 421, 422, 424, 429
    - No matter what you do, get a good summer internship.

* Part three: The Impact of Design

  - Less choices = More usable (Large task vs small task)
  - Automation of testing is good, extreme automation leads Vista downgrades to XP
  - "To create a usable piece of software, you have to fight for every fix, every feature, every little accommodation that will get one more person up the curve. There are no shortcuts. Luck is involved, but you don't win by being lucky, it happens because you fought for every inch" -
  - 2 problems
    1. No need to spec it out. Just write the code
    2. You hired programmers before you designed the thing. Because the only thing harder than trying to design software is trying to design software as a team.
  - Spec must not describe the product in terms of adjectives. Prefer specifics
      - "It will be extremely cool" v/s "It will have brushed-aluminum title bars and all the icons will be reflected a little bit, as if placed on a grand piano"
  - The tragedy of commons
  - e.g. Design alternative to IRC
      - What things are missed?  No channel, No seperate username
      - What things are useful and provide us the profit? channel, username

* Part four: Managing Large Projects

  * Excel complex file format - OLE
    - Why?
      - Fast on old computers.
      - Designed to use libraries.
      - Not designed with interoperability in mind.
   - Word and Excel have extremely complete object models, available via COM Automation, which allow you to programmatically do anything
  - No one pays for easy and obvious solution eg. Operative environment issues

* Part five: Programming Advice

  * Learn different languages e.g. Microsoft tangled in try catch while Google used map-reduce functional programming paradigm to achieve the scalability.
  * Make wrong code look wrong - eg. us - unsafe string v/s s - safe string
  * Hungarian notations make wrong code look wrong.
  * Use of conventions to find the bug.
  * Idealists(MSDN) vs Realists (Raymond Chen)
    - Work with standards v/s strive for backward compatibility

  * Evidence-based scheduling (EBS)
      - Deal with scope creep
      - Improve planning ability
      - Metics used in the EBS
        1. Break 'er down - Granulate the task upto hours
        2. Track elapsed time - To measure velocity - how fast the task was done relative to estimate.
        3. Simulate the future With Mote Carlo simulation
          Beware of obsessive-compulsive disorder.
        4. Manage your projects actively with excel and Gantt chart

* Part six: Starting a Software Business

    - Organic growth v/s disruptive growth
    - 3 simple micro-ISV rules
    1. Don't start a business if you can't explain what pain it solves, for whom, and why your product will eliminate this pain, and how the customer will pay to solve this pain.
    2. Don't start a business by yourself
    3. Don't expect much at first
    - Best working conditions -> Best programmers -> Best software -> Profit
    - Design adds value faster than it adds cost.
    - Mediocre programmer never hit the high notes
    - Sign Brad Pitt for your latest blockbuster movie, even though he demands a high salary, because that salary can be divided by all the millions of people who see the movie .


* Part seven: Running a Software Business

    - How offices should be?
      - Faciltiy of pair programming, private offices, hangout, resting faciltiy
    - iPod is successful with less features - 80/20 rule
    - Simplicity is overrated
    - Seven steps to remarkable customer service
        1. Fix everything two ways
            - Superficial, immediate and deeper solution
        2. Suggest blowing out the dust
        3. Make customers into fans
        4. Take the blame
        5. Memorize awkward phrases
        6. Practice puppetry
        7. Greed will get you nowhere
        8. (Bonus!) Give customer service people a career path

* Part eight: Releasing Software

    1. Frequent small releases - This is the Extreme Programming approach
    2. Every 12 to 18 months -  This is typical of shrink-wrapped software products, desktop applications, etc., where you have larger teams and thousands or millions of customers.
    3. Every 3 to 5 years -  This is typical of huge software systems and platforms

  * How not to set the software price?
    - Site licenses
    - "How much money do you have?" pricing

* Part nine: Revising Software

    - Root cause analysis with 5 Whys? (Toyota method)
