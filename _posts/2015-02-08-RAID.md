[A case study for Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disk (RAID)][link]

* Performance of any system depends on
  1.  CPU
  2.  Memory
  3.  I/O
* CPU and Memory performance increases according the Moore's law, however I/O on SLED(Single Large Expensive Drives) creates bottleneck.
* To improve performance and increase reliability RAID is used

* I/O system is evaluated based on the following attributes
### 1.Performance
     At abstract level 2 types of systems need to be considered to measure the performance
     1.TPS (Random access)
         Read,Write and modify (Search)
     2.SuperComputer applications (Sequential access)
         Read and write
### 2.Power consumption
### 3.Scalability
### 4.Cost
### 5.Reliability
    * Achieved by increasing the MTTF
    * However,the curse of the scalability
    * MTTF = MTTF of single disk/ # of disk
    * Ultimately if we increase the # of disks MTTF reduces
    * Idea : Use of MTTR
    * look at the bigger picture
    * reduction in the MTTR result into increase in the MTTF.
    * MTTF = (MTTF / G+C) * 1/prob. of another failure
    * prob. of another failure = MTTR / (MTTF / # of disks - 1)
    * Next prob of failure = MTTR / (MTTF / # of remaining disks - 1)

### RAID types
#### Types of disks used
*  Data disk  =  G
*  Check disk/parity disk  =  C
*  RAID0 (JBOD  =  Just Bunch of Disk) C = 0
*  RAID1  =  Mirrored Disk (G=C= 1)
   Double the storage cost/Use only 50% of the storage space
*  RAID2  =  Hamming code for error correction
   Error correction requires more disk than error detection
   A parity disk can detect the single error
*  RAID3  =  Single check disk/Parity disk per group
*  RAID4  =  Independent reads and writes
*  RAID5  =  Spread data * parity over all disks (no single check disk)

  [RAID can be implemented as an application using logical sectors and disk](https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/RAID_setup#Linear_mode)


#### Terms and Notations
* MTTF = Mean Time To Fail
* MTTR = Mean Time To Repair
